# Machine-learning-projects
    Here you can find a few of projects I've completed. The first project is an end-to-end machine learning project,
    and the second is a spam filter analysis. The data sets are taken from the UCI machine learning repository.
    
    In the folder Emotion_Based_Music_Player you will also find a project I have made in collaboration with Arne Pais, Fabien Van de Velde, and Tom Oostvogels. This is an AI interface intended to capture the emotions of a user and play music according to his or her emotion. When run, a web based user interface appears and allows the user to either input a photo or to make a live video recording. In the former case the program will analyse the emotions in the photo and then the user will have the option of playing a preselected piece of music based on his or her dominant emotion, or have an AI generated tune played based on all the emotions displayed, where the emotions are weighted according to the degree to which they appear. Emotions are detecting using the DeepFace library available in Python. The web interface has been made using streamlit, and is partly based on that of the project https://github.com/Mohammad-juned-khan/Face-detection-analysis-application. The CSV files contain chord sequences used to by the program in the file generator.py to generate a song based on the emotional input.
